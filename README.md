Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

Hi there!

This exercise is part of Coursera 1st assignement from "Exploratory Data Analysis".
As I'm not proficient using R, I've used the most basic tools I know for subseting and creating graphs. Hope you can performed a good critical review and help me to improve my coding.

Regards,
D
