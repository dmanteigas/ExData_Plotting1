Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

Hi there!

This exercise is part of Coursera 1st assignement from "Exploratory Data Analysis".
As I'm not proficient using R, I've used the most basic tools I know for subseting and creating graphs. Hope you can performed a good critical review and help me to improve my coding.

Basically, what I've tryed to do was to read the file, clean the dataset to use for the analysis and then plot the graphics. I've marked all the code in a way that could make it understandable. 

Regards,
D
